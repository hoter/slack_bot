# slack_bot

Let's imagine you have 100 people in your team. And you would like to congratulate each of them. But how can you remember all birthdays? And in this case this module will help you.

It will create a new private group in Slack and invite all people (except "man of the moment", of course). Then in 1 day it will archive this group.
